## Description
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

The overall aim is to put into practice the various skills learnt so far over the AICore bootcamp. And to make a fun little game in the progress of course.
