## Description
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

The overall aim is to put into practice the various skills learnt so far over the AICore bootcamp. And to make a fun little game in the progress of course. 

The project consists of a word list, a module that picks a random word from that list and 2 functions: one to check the guess is valid and a one asks for input then checks the guess by calling the first function. These fuctions are defined as methods within the class Hangman. That class is then made a variable within the function play_game(), which requires that word_list is passed as a parameter in order to run the game.
